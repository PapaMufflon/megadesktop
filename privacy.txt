Mega Desktop Privacy Policy

1. This app saves your MEGA login and password on your computer, 
encrypted by your Windows' password.

2. When runs, it sends an anonymous Installation ID,
so we can see how much users we have and what versions they installed.
The Installation ID is a MD5 cryptographic hash of computer name+user name.
We cannot recover your name from it.
Also, it downloads the update.txt from website to see if a new version is available.

3. If an unexpected error occurs, app will send the Error Code to us, 
so we can track errors.

4. Your IP address is NOT made available to us in either case.
However, Google Analytics and Github will probably have it in their logs.

If you are still not satisfied, you can download the source code from Github, 
remove the error reporting and update checks and compile it yourself.

Please also contact us and explain how we can improve this part of the app.

Thanks!
